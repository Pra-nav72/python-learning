#operators in Python

#arithmatic operator
#assignment operator
#comparison operator
#logical operator
#identity operator
#membership operator
#bitwise operator


#arithmatic operator-- used for numeric operation(+, -, *, /, **							{exponent}, //{qquotient}, %{remainder})




#assignment operator---these are used to assign value to the variables.
print("assignment operator")
x = 7   #here = is operator.
x +=5   #here += is cooperator that will add 7 and 5 and print 12.
print(x)   #google for more operator.....




#comparison operator---used to compare(==, <, >, <=, >=, !=, and, or etc)




#logical operator--  learn boolean algebra
print("logical operator")
a= True
b= False
print(a and b) #it will give false bcoz True and False = false, 					similarly(a or b) will give True bcoz of OR





#identity operator--(is, is not)
print("identity operator")
print(a is b) #false
print (a is not b) #True




#membership operator--(in, not in)
print("membership operator")
list= [1, 2, 23, 43 ,33]
print(2 in list) 
print(343 in list)
print(343 not in list)



#bitwise operator-- these operators work with bit that is with 						binary number.



#       and= (&),  or= (|)
