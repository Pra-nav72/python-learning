i= 0
while (i<33):
	print(i,end="")  #if we leave it here it will start printing                        the value of i without stoping. so to stop this                     we use.....i=i +1.   end="" used to write in 					horizontal line

	
	i = i +1    #when i + 1 will equal larger than 33 then the loop 				will stop.

# for loop ends when the it print all the items from the given list or whatever.   But while loop will run till the statement is correct.
