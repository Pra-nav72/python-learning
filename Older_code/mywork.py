#Booleans are created when comparing values. Python has a number of comparison operators: equal to ==, not equal to !=, greater than >, smaller than <, greater or equal to >=, smaller or equal to <=.

x= 7
print(x!=8)
print(x >6)
print(x<8)
print(x >=7)
print(x <= 7)


#Greater than and smaller than operators can also be used to compare strings lexicographically (the alphabetical order of words is based on the alphabetical order of their component letters). 

#The True and False Boolean values can be represented as integers 1 and 0, respectively. 
x= 7 >5
print(int(x)) #int() convert boolran to intrger
